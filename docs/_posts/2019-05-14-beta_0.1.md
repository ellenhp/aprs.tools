title: "aprs.tools is in open beta!"
---

Today marks the release of 0.1 beta. Try it if you dare. Expect crashes, bugs, frustration, tears and rage. The link to opt-in is [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/me.ellenhp.aprstools). Please send me any and all feedback about the look and feel of the app. The feature set is very limited. It's a read-only viewer for the APRS-IS network. I'm releasing it because I want to know if it crashes on older devices, if people hate the look and feel, if it's too slow to be usable, that sort of thing. Rome wasn't built in a day. :)
