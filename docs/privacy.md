# Privacy Policy

aprs.tools is an Android application that enables users to view information transmitted over the APRS network. To do this, aprs.tools makes connections to a server hosted in Google Cloud. These connections may transmit information about your device, such as manufacturer, model, and your Internet Protocol Address ("IP address"). An IP address is an address that can sometimes uniquely identify your device on the internet. This information may be stored indefinitely, but the developer will not share it with a third party unless required to by law.

In addition to the above-mentioned information, the requests that aprs.tools sends to the server contains information about which part of the world the app wants information about. Without this, the app would need to download the entire world's worth of APRS data, which could cost a lot of money if you download all that information on a cellular connection! The locations that you're requesting information about do not reveal exactly where you're looking for stations, but they do associate information about the geographic regions you're interested in with your IP address. I will not share this information with a third party unless required to by law.

This app also uses third party services to collect anonymized information about your device, and to collect anonymized data about the way the app is behaving. This information is useful so I can make technological choices as I continue to develop aprs.tools, and so that crashes can be identified and fixed. Many times, crashes are specific to one operating system version or one model of device, so collecting this data allows me to diagnose and fix issues without needing to find a device with the correct version of Android, or to purchase a new device just to figure out a bug. The specific third party service used is Google Play Services. You can find a copy fo the Google Play Services privacy policy at this link: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Additionally, this app uses the Google Maps API. This allows the app to display information about APRS stations on a map. By using the app you are agreeing to be bound by the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service, which are availble here: https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html

The privacy policy for the Google Maps API is located at the same link as the Google Play Services privacy policy, repeated here for easy reference: https://policies.google.com/privacy

The app also collects location information, but that information does not leave your device. In the future, you will have the ability to send beacon signals that contain your location information, but these signals will not be sent unless you consent to send information over the APRS network, and explicitly tell the app to start sending beacon signals. You will be able to revoke this consent at any time in the settings menu, and you will be able to stop sending new beacon signals at any time.

For anyone who isn't familiar with the way APRS works, information sent over APRS becomes public as soon as it leaves your device. This is the nature of APRS and nothing I can do will enable you to exert any amount of control over data you have previously sent. In many jurisdictions worldwide, information sent over amateur radio is legally considered public, and all APRS traffic can potentially be sent over amateur radio bands. Services such as APRSDirect and aprs.fi will store any data you send over APRS indefinitely, and there is no way that I know of for you to request its deletion. It is very important that you read the consent in the app throughly and understand it before sending information over the APRS network. Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
