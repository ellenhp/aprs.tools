# The goal

aprs.tools is an Android app written in Kotlin that aims to change how amateur radio operators interact with the APRS network.
Specifically, the 1.0 release of aprs.tools will include the features of an online APRS packet viewer like APRSDirect and aprs.fi, combined with the ability to interface with Bluetooth TNCs. You'll be able to seamlessly switch between picking up stations from APRS-IS and RF to picking up stations on RF only if your internet connection fails. While the internet connection is working, you'll have the ability to operate an IGate station from your phone to meaninfully contribute to the APRS-IS network.

# Current Status

aprs.tools is nowhere near the above stated goals. The feature set as of May 2019 is, to put it bluntly, aprs.fi but worse. aprs.tools is a passion project with one contributor, and any help is appreciated. I'm currently looking for help in all forms. Beta testing, feedback on the vision, unsolicited opinions, bug reports and feature wish-lists. It all helps. If someone would like to contribute code to the project please email me about it!
